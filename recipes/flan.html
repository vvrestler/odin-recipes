    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Flan is a caramel topped custard that originated from Southern Europe. It is now very popular in Latin America.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar (for caramelizing the molds)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>5 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using six 6-ounce molds, place them in a baking pan at least 2 inches deep</li>
            <li>Place 3/4 cup sugar and water in a small saucepan, bring to a boil, continue cooking until an amber color</li>
            <li>Immediately and carefully pour the hot sugar into the molds</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine remaining sugar, milk, and half-and-half. Over medium heat, stir until it comes to a simmer</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and egg yolks, slowly pour in warm milk</li>
            <li>Stir in vanilla</li>
            <li>Strain through a fine mesh strainer, as you pour or ladle the custard into the molds</li>
            <li>Add simmering water to the baking pan to create a hot water bath for the molds</li>
            <li>Bake 50 - 60 minutes or until barely set in the middle</li>
            <li>Let the custards cool in the hot water bath, which takes about an hour</li>
            <li>Refrigerate 2 hours before serving</li>
            <li>To serve, run a small knife around the top edge of each flan, place a serving plate on top of the mold, holding them together tightly, turn them over, and give a shake until you hear the flan plop onto the plate</li>
        </ol>
